# GameMaker Studio 2 First Look

## Introduction
	This tutorial is intended for those wanting an introducton to __GameMaker Studio 2__ using their scrpting language __GML__. This assumes no prior knowledge of the software or scripting. Unlike other tutorials, I have left the scripting in images so you can't cut and paste the text. When learning to script for the first time I think it is very important to type it in yourself and get used to making mistakes and develop an understanding of what you are typing does to the game engine.
		

	This is a primer before moving forward and creating your first game.  It is intended to demonstrate some fundamental concepts in the __IDE__, __GML__, and some very basic __game algorithms__.  

  Includes:

  * Variables
  * 3 Data types
	* Functions
  * If statements
  * Loops
  * Positioning objects in rooms
  * Errors
  * Moving NPC
  * Moving Player
