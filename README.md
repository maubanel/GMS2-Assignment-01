# GameMaker Studio 2 First Look

## Introduction
This tutorial is intended for those wanting an introducton to __GameMaker Studio 2__ using their scrpting language __GML__. This assumes no prior knowledge of the software or scripting. Unlike other tutorials, I have left the scripting in images so you can't cut and paste the text. When learning to script for the first time I think it is very important to type it in yourself and get used to making mistakes and develop an understanding of what you are typing does to the game engine.
  

This is a primer before moving forward and creating your first game.  It is intended to demonstrate some fundamental concepts in the __IDE__, __GML__, and some very basic __game algorithms__.  

Includes:

* Variables
* 3 Data types
* Functions
* If statements
* Loops
* Positioning objects in rooms
* Errors
* Moving NPC
* Moving Player

| Constants            | This is a value of a type that never changes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | vk_up                                                                                                      |
| Real Number          | This is a type that represents any whole number  and is a double precision floating point value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | -25.5                                                                                                      |
| String               | This is a type that represents any text and is surrounded by quotation marks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | "This is a sentence"                                                                                       |
| Boolean              | This is a type that represents either true or false.   GML does not have a boolean type and uses a real number  to represent true and false.  Any real number below 0.5 is false and any  number equal or above is true.                                                                                                                              | b_is_visible = true                                                                                        |
| Variable             | A variable can store either a real number or a string. When the game  runs the variable is replaced with the value that it contains.  You assign a variable using the equal sign `=`.                                                                                                                                                                 | speed = 20;                                                                                                |
| Variable Definitions | This is a way that you can initialize the value of a variable both inside the game object (just under the Physics button) and allows you to give different values inside the room.                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                            |
| String Concatenation | When adding two strings together "Hello " + "there." it combines (concatenates)  the two strings into a single "Hello there".                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | "Hello " + "Steve!"                                                                                        |
| if statement         | A simple "if" statement takes this form: if (condition) { .. run script between brackets if true ...}.  If the condition within the parentheses is true, the  script right after within the braces runs if the condition is true. Be careful, do NOT put a semi-colon after the parenthesis between the closing parenthesis )  and opening bracket {. | if (age >= 18) {    draw_text(x, y, "adult"); }                                                            |
| else if statement    | An "else if" statement comes after an if() or else if() statement  (they can be chained).  The next else if runs if the previous statement resolves  to false.Be careful, do NOT put a semi-colon after the parenthesis between the  closing parenthesis ) and opening bracket {.                                                                     | if&#160;(age&#160;>=&#160;18)<br />{<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;draw_text&#160;(x,&#160;y,&#160;"adult"); }<br />else&#160;if&#160;(age&#160;==&#160;17)<br />{<br />draw_text(x,&#160;y,&#160;"17&#160;year&#160;old");<br />} |
| else                 | After a chain of if and else if statements, if none of them are true you can  create a final statement that will always run with else.                                                                                                                                                                                                                | if (age >= 18) {   draw_text(x, y, "adult"); } else {   draw_text(x, y, "minor"); }                        |
| == expression        | If the value on either side of the == operator are identical then the result is  true.  If the values are not the same it returns false.                                                                                                                                                                                                              | if (i == j) {   draw_text(x, y, "i and j are                      the same"; }                             |
| != expression        | If the value on either side of the != (not equal) operator are different then the result is true.  If the values are identical the return is false.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | if (i != j) {   draw_text(x, y, "i and j are                    different"; }                              |
| > expression         | Returns true if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right. Otherwise returns false.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | if (age > 18)                                                                                              |
| >= expression        | Returns true if the value on the left is greater or equal to the value on the  right. Otherwise returns false.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                            |
| < expression         | Returns true if the value on the left is less than the value on the right. Otherwise returns false.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                            |
| <= expression        | Returns true if the value on the left is less or equal than the value on the  right.Otherwise returns false.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                            |
| function             | A function is a block of code that performs a function.  It then can return a value.  You may or may not need to pass the function arguments that it  needs to perform its task.  foo = function_name(argument0, argument1...); calls a function, sets the return value to foo and and passes arguments.                                              | av = average(3,4,5); note: this function returns the real number of 4 that is stored in the `av` variable. |
| repeat loop          | Allows you to perform a task multiple times.  `repeat (10)` { enter script here }  will run what is between the brackets 10 times.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |  margin = 32; repeat(lives) {     draw_sprite(obj_heart, 0, x, y);   x += margin  }                        |
| for loop             | Allows you to perform a task multiple time.   for (staring_point, end_point, increment or decrement)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | for (int i=0; i < lives; ++i) {   draw_sprite(obj_heart, 0, x + i * margin, y); }                          |
| sprite origin        | This is the x, y position in local space of the sprite that it is drawn from in the room.  It is also the point that the sprite rotates around when rotating                                                                                                                                                                                          | sprite_set_offset(spr_player, 32, 32);                                                                     |
